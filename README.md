## FindFiesta

## Description
FindFiesta is an app created for ComS 309 at Iowa State University. It was a semester-long team project with two team members on backend and two on frontend. I worked on the frontend with another programmer, hence why only the frontend code is posted here. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete accounts, login, create, delete, and edit posts for lost/found items, search for other users and view and follow/unfollow their profiles, view google maps that has markers for all items posted, direct message users or message all users in the public chat, report posts/accounts, and many more features! The ultimate goal was to create an almost social media for a lost and found system.

## Usage
The app is intended to be used for people to find items they've lost or help others do the same. However, our app is not published and the server is only intended for classroom use.
